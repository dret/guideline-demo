Change Management Policy</span></label><div class="cd-accordion__sub cd-accordion__sub--l1">
               <p>One of the typical goals of APIs is to cleanly and clearly decouple how a capability
                  is provided, and how it is consumed. The API becomes the only interface that exists
                  between the producer and the consumer. This decoupling enables a more agile landscape
                  of evolving products and product users in general, and one of the aspects is that
                  producers and consumers can evolve their products individually, based on their needs
                  and timelines.
               </p>
               <p>With API products and their consumers changing individually, it is important to have
                  a well-defined and documented process how changes in the API are communicated and
                  engineered. The goal is to balance two factors. One factor is the ease of consumption
                  so that consumers do not have to worry about their products being disrupted because
                  an API they are using is changing and breaking it. The second factor is the ease of
                  production where the API product owners want to be able to evolve their product, without
                  having to coordinate with all consumers of the API, and having to wait for them to
                  make changes.
               </p>
               <p>There are different ways how this goal can be achieved, and picking one of them depends
                  on the value that is assigned to making changes work for every single consumer, and
                  making it easier for the API product team to evolve their API when necessary.

                        <p>One possible way to handle change management is to design extensibility into the API
                           itself. By using extensible design, changes to the API can take advantage of this
                           extensibility, and existing consumers can continue to use the API without having to
                           adjust.
                        </p>
                        <p>The specific design depends on the API style and technology, and on the intended extensibility.
                           Regardless of the style and technology, design options will usually fall between these
                           two extremes:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>No extensibility is the easiest design and allows consumers to fully rely on the API
                              as it is when they write their code. However, with this design option there is no
                              extensibility at all, making it impossible for the API producer to make any changes
                              to the API without breaking existing consumers.
                           </li>
                           <li>Unlimited extensibility is the hardest design and allows producers to change everything
                              in the API, allowing them unconstrained changes to the API. However, with this design
                              option it becomes hard for consumers to fully implement support for all possible extensions,
                              making it hard for consumers to use the API.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In practice, most extensibility designs fall somewhere in the middle between these
                           options, trying to strike a balance between allowing some extensibility, while still
                           making it relatively easy to consume the API without having to support a very complex
                           extensibility model. The patterns discussed in <cite ref="robust-extensibility"></cite> are one possible way to design for evolution.

Meaningful Error Messages</span></label><div class="cd-accordion__sub cd-accordion__sub--l1">
               <p>Most APIs use styles where things can go wrong. The more helpful an API is in explaining
                  what went wrong, and how a developer or user might be able to address the problem,
                  the more easy the API is to use.
               </p>
               <p>It is important to keep in mind that in case of error messages, a better Developer
                  Experience (DX) with more helpful and clearly structured error messages directly translates
                  into the possibility to create a better User Experience (UX). If the API only produces
                  one generic error messages, that is the only thing that an application can display
                  to the user. If, on the other hand, the error message is descriptive and machine-understandable,
                  applications can at the very least display more meaningful error messages, and ideally
                  even implement behavior that mitigates the effects of the error.

                        <p>Error messages benefit from using a shared structure that can be used across various
                           APIs. The structure should define the most important aspects of error messages across
                           APIs, and should also allow extensions so that individual APIs can extend the error
                           messages with additional details. Using a standardized error format has two main advantages.
                        </p>
                        <p>The first advantage is that it makes it easier for developers and humans to work with
                           various APIs. It is only necessary to understand the error message format one time,
                           and then this understanding works across all APIs. Error messages still can be made
                           very expressive and rich by adding details through the format's extension mechanism.
                        </p>
                        <p>The second advantage is that it becomes possible to build tooling around the format.
                           One form of tooling can be libraries that make it easier foe developers to produce
                           or consume error messages. Another form of tooling is that it becomes much easier
                           to observe error messages across the entire API landscape, making it relatively easy
                           to build tooling that consumes and analyzes error messages for an entire API landscape.

Notifications in Request/Response APIs</span></label><div class="cd-accordion__sub cd-accordion__sub--l1">
               <p>Many API styles are focused on request/response interaction patterns: The API provides
                  a service that is invoked by a client and then produces a response that the client
                  consumes and processes. This pattern underlies the major API styles such as RPC, URI,
                  REST, and query-based. In all these styles, clients send requests that are processed
                  on the server-side.
               </p>
               <p>However, it is possible that clients want to be notified when something happens on
                  the server side. Typical examples for this are state changes on the server side, where
                  clients may be interested to learn about state changes of resources they are interested
                  in. Implementing this functionality in a pure request/response interaction pattern
                  can be wasteful, because clients then need to keep polling the server, wasting bandwidth
                  and server resources.
               </p>
               <p>In terms of interaction patterns, it would be better so implement this with a notification
                  that is initiated by the server. For this to work, this requires some sort of subscription
                  mechanism where a client declares interest in a (set of) published resources, so that
                  notifications can be delivered to the subscribed clients. This general pattern is
                  called Publish/Subscribe (PubSub), and can be implemented in a variety of ways.

                        <p>For notifications not using the request/response pattern, it is possible to use a

                           to receive these notifications. There are a variety of possible messaging platforms
                           that can be used for this scenario, and depending on the messaging platform, there
                           may be different models of how to subscribe to notifications, and how these notifications
                           are delivered via the messaging platform.

Using Timestamps</span></label><div class="cd-accordion__sub cd-accordion__sub--l1">
               <p>Timestamps (combining date and time information, sometimes allowing data-only formats
                  as well) are a popular data type in APIs. However, representing these timestamps is
                  not trivial, as date and time information is influenced by aspects such as timezones,
                  daylight savings settings, and reference points for dates and times.
               </p>
               <p>It therefore makes sense to use existing formats for timestamps that handle the complexities
                  of date and time representation in well-defined ways. By using consistently using
